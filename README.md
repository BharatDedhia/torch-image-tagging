<h1>IMAGE TAGGING</h1>
<b>Domain:</b> AI, ML/DL, Image Processing.<br>
<b>Description:</b>
There are already popular models that will allow to find and determine what objects are present in an image. This use case takes the same one level further, it also contains association of tags to the images to improve their searchability. The same can be done on 2 levels, the basic level being to tag using similar meaning words which is quite simple. And the more advanced version of the same being that the interns will have to find associated words too. So, for example, if crown is an object detected, king and queen should also be tagged.

## Objectives and Features Completed:

1.	Loaded a pretrained model - We have successfully loaded a pretrained model - RESNET 50 (Residual Network with 50 layers) which is trained on imagenet dataset.
2.	Loaded a dataset - ImageNet dataset has over 14 million images maintained by Stanford University. It is extensively used for a large variety of Image related deep learning projects. The images belong to various classes or labels.
3.	Specify image transformations- Various transformations like resize, center crop, normalization, etc are specified.
4.	Load the image and pre-process it - Read the input image and perform the image transformations specified.
5.	Model Interference - Use the pre-trained weights to find out the output vector. Each element in this output vector describes the confidence with which the model predicts the input image to belong to a particular class.
6.	Forward Pass: Based on the scores obtained, display the predictions.
7.	Give the synonyms for the prediction of the image using Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) Library.

## Usage

### Installation 
Initially we installed TorchVision module using the command given below

 <i>pip install torchvision</i>

Next, we imported models from torchvision module

 <i>from torchvision install models<br>
 import torch<br>
 dir (models)</i>

Once we have the model with us, the next step is to transform the input image so that they have the right shape and other characteristics like mean and standard deviation. We can pre-process the input image with the help of transforms present in TochVision module.

 <i>from torchvision import transforms<br>
 transform = transforms.Compose([<br>
 transforms.Resize(256),<br>
 transforms.CenterCrop(224),<br>
 transforms.ToTensor(),<br>
 transforms.Normalize(<br>
 mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406],<br>
 std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225],<br>
 )])</i>

Now to input image and carry out the image transformations we have specified above. We have used Pillow (PIL) module extensively with TorchVision as itâ€™s the default image backend supported by TorchVision.

 (# Import Pillow)
from PIL import Image

Next, we imported NTLK library and installed Wordnet to get a collection of words and vocabulary from English language that are related to each other and grouped in some other ways.

 <i>import nltk<br>
 nltk.download('wordnet')</i>
